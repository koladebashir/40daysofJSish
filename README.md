# 🚀 40 Days of JavaScript: Deep Dive into Core Mechanics

This repository is a structured journey through the internal workings and modern features of JavaScript. My goal is to move beyond "just coding" to understanding how the **V8 Engine** processes code and how to write memory-efficient, performant applications.

The learning path is guided by the expert tutorials from [Tapas Adhikary's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/TapasAdhikary).
