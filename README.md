# 🚀 40 Days of JavaScript: Deep Dive into Core Mechanics

This repository is a structured journey through the internal workings and modern features of JavaScript. My goal is to move beyond "just coding" to understanding how the **V8 Engine** processes code and how to write memory-efficient, performant applications.

The learning path is guided by the expert tutorials from [Tapas Adhikary's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/TapasAdhikary).

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

* 
**Engine Internals:** Understanding JIT compilation, Tokenization, and Abstract Syntax Trees (AST).


* 
**Execution Context:** Mastering the Call Stack and how the JavaScript engine manages global and functional execution.


* 
**Memory Management:** Differentiating between **Stack** (for primitives) and **Heap** (for objects) and avoiding memory leaks.


* 
**Advanced Patterns:** Closures, Lexical Scoping, and Explicit Binding (`.call`, `.apply`, `.bind`).
